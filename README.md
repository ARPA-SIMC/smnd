# SMND

## Software for Meteorology, Normally Distributed ##
> the software for sure, the meteorological data not really.

SMND is a helper package for simplifying the build and the deployment
of a collection of meteorological software packages, mainly developed
by [Arpae-SIMC](http://www.arpa.emr.it/sim). The current version is
relatively stable, including the universal binary package.

The software packages involved, all open source and freely redistributable, are:

 - [grib_api](https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/GRIB/Home) from
   ECMWF
 - [wreport](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/wreport)
 - [bufr2netcdf](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/bufr2netcdf)
 - [DB.All-e](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/dballe)
 - [arkimet](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/arkimet)
 - [libsim](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/libsim)

### Building the software from source ###

If you wish to build the software packages on your own, please follow
the instructions in the relevant [wiki
page](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/smnd/wiki/BuildFromSource).

The build process has been tested on Fedora 20 and 24 and on CentOS 7
x84_64 GNU/Linux dstributions, it is not supported on other
distros/platforms at the moment.

### Installing the universal binary package ###

The most interesting feature ot this project is however the universal
binary package, which is also downloadable in the [release
section](https://github.com/dcesari/smnd/releases).

The binary package has been built on a Fedora 20 x86_64 GNU/Linux
distribution, however it contains all the necessary libraries, so
that, in principle, it can work on any Linux x86_64 system with kernel
2.6.32 or newer.

For installation you do not need to be root, you just have to unpack
the package and run a script:

```
# cd to the desired intallation directory and unpack the package
tar -zxvf smnd-0.9_unibin.tar.gz
# enter the newly created directory
cd smnd
# complete the installation by creating wrappers to executables
# and the `$HOME/smnd_profile`
./install_from_bin.sh
```

In order to run any command of the SMND collection, you have to
preliminary source the profile once with `. $HOME/smnd_profile` in the
working session. The profile for universal installation just prepends
`unibin/` to the `PATH` environment variable, so it can be integrated
with the user's shell profile scripts or moved to a different
location.

If you relocate the binary installation, the `install_from_bin.sh`
script has to be rerun from the new location.

Before version 2.0, a single universal binary installation, after
running the `install_from_bin.sh` script, records an hardcoded value
of the absolute installation path, so it is usable only if reached
under that path. Since version 2.0 it is possible to access the same
physical installation from different paths, e.g. when it is on an nfs
share having different mountpoints on different systems; for that
purpose, the `install_from_bin.sh` should be run from within every
system involved for creating a specialized `smnd_profile` file.

The binary installation turns out to be a self-made container,
according to the current IT slang. It may be distributed as a real
container of some known standard in the future.

### GPL compliance ###

The universal binary distribution contains various libraries in binary
form from Fedora rpms, please contact the author in order to receive
the corresponding source packages for GPL compliance.

## SMND and SMND ##

The package SMND is not related to the **SMND** meant as the Italian
*Servizio Meteorologico Nazionale Distribuito*, because, according to
our knowledge, Servizio Meteorologico Nazionale Distribuito does not
exist. Please inform us when it will be created.

> Il pacchetto software SMND non ha nessun legame con il **Servizio
> Meteorologico Nazionale Distribuito** in quanto il Servizio
> Meteorologico Nazionale Distribuito non esiste. Si pregano i
> competenti organi di informarci quando esso verrÃ  istituito.
