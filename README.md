### Software Meteorologico Normalmente Distribuito
**Software for Meteorology Normally Distributed**, whatever this may mean

This project is a container for simplifying the building and the distribution of various meteorological software packages. Not all the packages involved are publicly available now, so for the moment this is just an empty container, we hope to fill it soon.


The project will distribute a source package for building autonomously all the software suite, and an universal binary installation package allowing a quick install on a reasonably recent x86_64 Linux system with a kernel >= 2.6.32.
